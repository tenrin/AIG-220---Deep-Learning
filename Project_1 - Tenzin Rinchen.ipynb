    "   - The optimization algorithm converges even faster when the data are normalized.\n",
    "   - Reduces biases in the weights\n",
    "2. Using the RELU activation function has several advantages. It allows the model to learn complex patterns. It is simple and highly efficient. Unlike other activation functions, RELU doesnt saturate positive values, which is advantageous in the backpropagation process.\n",
    "3. It is important to use GPU for training the neural network for several reasons:\n",
    "   - Parallel processing : with the help of GPU, the model can run parallel computation. Since deep learning involves numerous matrix multiplications, the process can be sped up highly.\n",
    "   - Reduced Training time: This parallel processing feature helps in reducting the training time significantly.\n",
    "   - High dimensional data handling : can handle high dimensional computation with ease.\n",
    "4.Training for Pytorch took much longer while Tensorflow processed it with ease. Although the model used is similar, there is a difference in the implementation for eg.weigh initiliazation, optimizer configuration which could attribute in the difference between these two frameworks performance.
